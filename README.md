# Office-Game-Boundaries-of-Swing
Description of project In this project I work with Java Swing trying to test the boundaries of what I can do with it. I work with window focusing as well as thread management. I also work on running a runnable game within a JLayered Pane. I work with focusing components and a variety of other things as well.
